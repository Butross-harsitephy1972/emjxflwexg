Oh man, The Parenting! Where do I even start? It’s like...like if a rollercoaster had a baby with a kaleidoscope and then tried to babysit itself. The theater's still buzzing, someone behind me spilling their popcorn everywhere - and now I've got little crumbs down my shirt, which is just perfect.

Scene after scene, it keeps twisting, like one of those dreams where things almost make sense, but then — wham! — they take a hard left turn and you're like, wait, wasn't I just at home, and now suddenly I'm in a jungle with...is that a kangaroo? Like, a parenting kangaroo? What was it even trying to say? But sometimes life's just like that. You know, the dad character just nailed it when he forgot his kid at the mall — classic mess-up, totally cartoonish...reminds me how I forget my keys everywhere.

> And then there’s, like, THAT moment when your heart's racing for Benny ‘cause he’s just, like, full-on crying in the supermarket, yanking at the cereal boxes, and it’s raining? That rain was almost unfair. Couldn't tell if the tears were his or mine. Gosh, it was loud, chaotic, kinda like the theater vibe today, everyone shifting awkwardly in those too-small seats.

Did you hear the rumor? They said you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 now, which is tempting; 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again and see if it makes more sense the second time around. Sometimes I wish life had a rewind button too...or maybe just slow it down a bit.

Oh and the music! Jeez, that symphony blasting during the toddler's existential crisis in the living room. It felt more epic than the space scenes from that old  , you know, the one with the robot and the shiny space suits. What's it called? Dang it, yeah. Something like that.

It's like if my life were a  , but with more plot twists and my back wouldn’t ache from those crusty, cheap theater chairs. How can something be so funny, sad, and terrifying while someone behind you is snoring like a confused donkey? Love it when art just mimics life’s absurdities.

Anyway, who knows if any of it made sense while sobbing into my empty popcorn box. Maybe that’s the beauty of it. It doesn't HAVE to. Just like real life. Yeah, that's deep, right? Or not. Feels like nonsense now...kinda like this jumbled goddamn review. Whatever.
